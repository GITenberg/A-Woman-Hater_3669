description: This 1876-7 novel continued the author's focus on trade unionism from
  his 1870 Put Yourself in His Place , while adding the element of a female physician
  named Rhoda Gould to the mix in order to express support for women's rights. Rhoda
  must overcome the prejudices of the misogynistic Vizard before she can pursue her
  dream.
